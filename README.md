## 🔒 Security Notes

- **App Passwords for Gmail**:
  - If using Gmail, enable **2-Step Verification** and create an **App Password**. [Learn how to create an app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like email passwords.
  - Use environment variables to securely manage credentials.

---

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Error**:
  - Ensure the email and password are correct.
  - For Gmail, use an App Password instead of your regular password.

- **Connection Issues**:
  - Verify your internet connection.
  - Ensure the SMTP server (`smtp.gmail.com`) and port (`587`) are accessible.

- **Invalid Email Format**:
  - Double-check the sender and recipient email addresses.
